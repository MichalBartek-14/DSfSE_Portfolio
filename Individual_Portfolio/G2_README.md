# G2: Improve my Workflow  
**Improve the structuring of the workload and communicate it clearly with the team.**  

## Background  
As my second goal, I aimed to establish a clear workflow and communication within the team. This goal was set to define the boundaries of my competencies and responsibilities in the data project. Over the three-week span, it was essential for me to understand my role in the team and what was expected of me. I wanted to communicate these expectations clearly with the team.  

I was assigned to a great team of students who provided me with opportunities to grow and learn during the process. Additionally, I was given the chance to lead the scripting part of the project, which became key towards the end. Communication played an important role in this goal, as all steps needed to be communicated clearly.  

## Process  
Since this goal was dedicated exclusively to the team project, I began by sharing my ideas and strengths with the team from the outset.  

During data acquisition, I took responsibility for acquiring the HARMONIE data via API. After successfully downloading this data, I was appointed to assist with the coding part of the project.  

I clearly defined my workload, working during the afternoons and additional off-school hours to provide a foundation for other team members if needed. This primarily involved preparing core datasets by cleaning the data. This phase of clearly defined tasks was mostly limited to the first two weeks of the project.  

In the latter stages, the boundaries became less clear, and my workload was not efficiently balanced due to issues in other areas of the team project. I stepped in to help other team members solve technical problems. As the deadline approached, team dynamics changed, and cross-functional roles emerged to achieve satisfactory results.  

## Results  
The key results of this goal included daily meetings where tasks were divided, and workflows were communicated. A more tangible outcome was the **planning sheet**, where we set deadlines and documented notes from each team member.  

I provide the example of the planning sheet, which was complemented by daily physical meetings with my teammates.

## Reflection  
In the initial stages, I successfully met my goal of clearly communicating my agenda and deadlines. However, in the final stages, I realized that it is impossible to fully anticipate the complexity of a project and the shifting dynamics of team workflows.  

For future projects, I understand the importance of being **flexible** with competencies and skill sets, as this is a crucial attribute of a data scientist in a team. Additionally, I now fully appreciate the importance of **team communication** and the **conceptualization of each team memberâ€™s agenda**.  

### Self-Assessment  
- **Communication with the Team:** 90%  
- **Structuring Workflow/Workload:** 80%
