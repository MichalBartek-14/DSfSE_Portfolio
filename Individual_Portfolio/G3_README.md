# G3: Information - How to Set Up an Analysis  

## Background  
For this goal, I aimed to gain more insights into the statistical analysis of data. Before the project, I hoped to conduct complex analyses; however, I underestimated the complexity of the data project, where analysis represented only a small part of the work.  

Since I had not yet encountered the dataset, it was difficult to define this goal more clearly than simply aiming to set up statistical analyses. After successfully formatting the data, I worked on this goal, though much later than initially anticipated.  

## Process  
Due to the project schedule and limited implementation time, the analysis phase only began in the latter part of **Week 2 and Week 3**. At this point, the team and I discussed meaningful analysis ideas using the available data. We concluded that we would **compare the HARMONIE model with real-time data from 2021**.  

I approached this problem by:  
1. Familiarizing myself with the datasets.  
2. Plotting correlations and relationships within the data.  
3. Creating a **regression model** for comparison.  

To practice analysis techniques outside the project, I watched publicly available video content on **statistical analysis in data science** and used **generative AI tools** to explain different techniques, including **machine learning algorithms**.  

From the course content, I particularly enjoyed and learned from:  
- **The clustering lecture (Week 3)**  
- **The machine learning tutorials (Week 2) with Jupyter notebooks**  

## Results  
For our project, I created **correlation matrices, regression models, and other graphs** that best represented the data and relationships within it. I also developed a **regression model comparing the HARMONIE data and weather station data**, which was ultimately used as the **final model** for our presentation.  

### Example: Correlation Analysis  
Here I present the **correlation between the model and station data**, which showed a **high correlation**.

### Example: Machine Learning Attempt  
Additionally, I attempted to **produce a machine learning algorithm** to predict energy production. However, this model had **low overall accuracy** and a **low RÂ² score**, making it unsuitable for final use.  

Since the pictures cannot be added into README, they are included in the summarizing documents.
