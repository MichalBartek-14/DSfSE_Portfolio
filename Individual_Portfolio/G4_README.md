# G4: Knowledge - Data Ethics, the Consequences of My Actions in Data  

## Background  
For my final personal goal, I aimed to expand my knowledge of **data ethics**, a topic I had not explored much before. I expected this course to help improve my understanding through interesting historical examples and reflections on ethics and morals within our project.  

## Process  
The courseâ€™s emphasis on this topic helped me achieve my goal, as multiple lectures and assignments directly addressed data ethics. I improved my understanding of **good practices** in data and algorithms, as well as the potential negative effects of **bad practices**.  

I gained significant insights from:  
- **The lecture on January 9, 2025**  
- A **prerecorded session on epistemic and normative concerns**  

I applied this knowledge to create a **poster** reflecting the ethical considerations in our project, based on materials from the lectures. I also discussed the outcomes with my team and shared ideas during the **Week 4 sharing session**.  

## Results  
The primary outcome of this goal was the **poster**, which reflected on the **ethical practices** followed in our project and identified areas for improvement. Additionally, I compiled notes from lectures and videos that helped me organize my understanding of **data ethics in data science**.  

### Example: Data Ethics Poster  
Here is the **poster** I created for the data ethics discussion in our project.  

**Poster reflecting the data ethics in our project.**  

## Reflection  
I acquired a substantial amount of knowledge about **ethical practices** in data science. I now grasp the importance of concepts such as **consent** and **privacy** in the context of data. I believe I fully met the expectations and objectives I set for this goal.  

### Self-Assessment
