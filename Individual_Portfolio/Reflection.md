## Reflection on the Learning Process (with BCC)  
The team I had the chance to work with during this project was a very good way to meet my learning goals. Everybody was helpful and enthusiastic about the project, which allowed for a smooth process.  

As one of the BCC, I would highlight the **different scientific backgrounds** we came from. I had more experience with **coding** and **acquiring the data**, which helped us during the initial stages of the project. On the other hand, my teammates had more experience with **statistical analysis** and **physics** regarding our project topic - **wind turbines**. Here, we complemented each other well and were able to teach each other new skills. The perseverance and enthusiasm of all the team members meant we did not mind working more on certain parts of the project, since everybody showed clear commitment.  

Another **boundary-crossing challenge** in the project was **cultural differences**. Two team members were Dutch, while the other two, including myself, were international students. These differences extended not only to our experiences with the topic of wind turbines but also to communication styles within the project. Fortunately, this did not cause significant issues, as we made an effort to communicate our expectations and areas of expertise beforehand. Through **open** and **transparent communication**, we were able to address any challenges and align our efforts effectively across our cultural backgrounds.  

## Reflection on the Project  
The project has provided a strong basis for me to train and practice my skills in a real-world scenario. However, the usability and potential of the outcomes of our group project can be questioned. In the field of **wind energy**, much of the research has already been done before. We treated our project mostly to replicate and confirm already known facts, rather than come up with groundbreaking research in this topic.  

The outcomes we have produced are already known and well-embedded in the theme. We have confirmed the accuracy of the **HARMONIE model** on locations within the Netherlands and found relationships between the **energy produced from wind turbines** and influential predictor factors such as the **location of the turbine** or **height of the turbine**.  

Overall, I am satisfied with our project results since we have successfully confirmed known information and simultaneously have practiced on the real datasets within the **data science team**.
