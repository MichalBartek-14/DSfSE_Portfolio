# DSfSE_Portfolio
This is a repository incorporating the Individual Portfolio for the course of Data Science for Smart Environments.

**In this github page I include three folders:**
1. **Individual Portfolio folder**, which includes all the readme files for each goal (as requested from the format on Brightspace), as well as the document that summarizes all the components for more clarity.
2. **Individual Portfolio Python scripts**, which includes all the scripts that I have created throughout the course.
3. **Individual Portfolio Results**, which includes the results I have produced during the course. (Not all visuals have been uploaded to the GitHub page, I have uploaded only those which were relevant to the learning goals).

Overall, I had a great time implementing and improving my knowledge in data science during this course.  
Hope you enjoy reading through my progress,  
Michal Bartek
